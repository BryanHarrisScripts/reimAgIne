Title: Estimating Rendering Time Based on Specific Configuration Settings

---

In this post, we aim to provide a simplified method to estimate the rendering time based on specific configuration settings. It's important to note that this method involves a lot of assumptions and may not provide exact results but should serve as a reasonable ballpark estimate.

### Configuration Settings Utilized for Estimation:
- ControlNet strength: 0.8
- Denoising strength: 1 (0: fully recover the input, 1.05: fully rerender the input)
- Steps: 25
- CFG scale: 4.5
- Key frame frequency (K): 2
- Number of key frames: 59
- Update frequency every N key frames: 5
- Loose Cross-frame attention: Yes
- Number of parallel processes: 5 (This will always be set to 5)

### Pre-requisites for Estimation:
- Understanding of Key Frame Frequency and Number of Key Frames: The "Key Frame Frequency (K)" implies a key frame will be generated every K frames, and "Number of Key Frames" implies the total number of key frames to be generated. Therefore, the total number of frames to be processed would be \(K \times \text{Number of Key Frames}\). In this example, it is \(2 \times 59 = 118\).
  
- Time taken to process each frame: Based on the data provided, the time taken to process each frame ranged from 32 to 34 seconds per run, with each frame having two runs. This totals to an average of 33 seconds per frame.

### Estimation Steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Rendering Time in Seconds:**
   \[ \text{Total Rendering Time (Seconds)} = \text{Total Number of Frames} \times \text{Average Time per Frame (Seconds)} \]
   \[ \text{Total Rendering Time (Seconds)} = 118 \times 33 = 3,894 \]

2. **Convert the Total Rendering Time to Hours:**
   \[ \text{Total Rendering Time (Hours)} = \frac{\text{Total Rendering Time (Seconds)}}{3600} \]
   \[ \text{Total Rendering Time (Hours)} ≈ \frac{3,894}{3600} ≈ 1.08 \]

### Conclusion:
With the updated configuration settings and the new average time per frame, the estimated total rendering time is approximately 1.08 hours or about 65 minutes. This estimation assumes that the time to process each frame remains consistent throughout the rendering process.

This method is simplified and does not take into account potential variations in frame processing time, system performance, or other factors that may affect rendering time. It's advised to monitor actual rendering times and adjust estimates accordingly for future projects.
